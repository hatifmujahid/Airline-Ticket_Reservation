Functionality:
File Management:
Admin is responsible for making sure the filing is correct and is able to delete any other entity found in
the database e.g., Customer, staff etc.

Ticket Booking:
Staff is responsible for booking ticket. This staff class was modelled for use in an airport setting.

Ticket Checking:
Ticket booked can be printed and checked by comparison from ticket number randomly generated and
stored in a file.

Payment:
Payment class in the program has to options:
1) Card Payment
2) Online Banking
Both these options enable user to pay the airline for their respective tickets.
Security:
By using XOR encryption we have made password more secure by prompting user to have a key in
addition to their passwords. The key is then to be remembered and is then used in the logging in
procedure.
Features:
1) XOR encryption
2) Text Filing
3) All inclusive from booking to payment. Everything is present in this program.

Limitations:
1) Seating is currently not supported.
2) If key is forgotten by user, then there is no way to recover their data.
